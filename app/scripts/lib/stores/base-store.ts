 * - Implement a `get` method that retrieves the current state from the
 * underlying storage system. This method should return `null` when the
 * state is unavailable.
 *
 * 2. **Set State:**
 * - Implement a `set` method that updates the state in the underlying
 * storage system. This method should handle necessary validation or
 * error handling to ensure the state is persisted correctly.
