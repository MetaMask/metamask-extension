/**
 * The PersistenceManager class serves as a high-level manager for handling
 * storage-related operations using a local storage system. It provides methods to read
 * and write state, manage metadata, and handle errors or corruption in the
 * underlying storage system.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. **State Management:**
 * - Tracks the most recently retrieved state
 * - reads state from the storage system
 * - writes updated state to the storage system
 *
 * 2. **Metadata Handling:**
 * - Manages a `metadata` object containing versioning information for the
 * state tree. The version is used to ensure consistency and proper
 * handling of migrations.
 *
 * 3. **Error Management:**
 * - Tracks whether data persistence is failing and logs appropriate errors
 * - Captures exceptions during write operations and reports them using
 * Sentry
 *
 *
 * Usage:
 * The `PersistenceManager` is instantiated with a `localStore`, which is an
 * implementation of the `BaseStore` class (either `ExtensionStore` or
 * `ReadOnlyNetworkStore`). It provides methods for setting and retrieving
 * state, managing metadata, and handling cleanup tasks.
