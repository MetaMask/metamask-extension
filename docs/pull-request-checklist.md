# Pull Request Checklist

Use this checklist to keep PRs easy to review.

## Checklist
- [ ] My change is small and focused (one topic)
- [ ] I wrote a clear title and short description
- [ ] I linked a related issue (if any)
- [ ] Docs changes match the repo tone/style
- [ ] I avoided unrelated formatting changes

## Notes for reviewers
- Prefer clarity over extra detail
- If a change is large, split it into smaller PRs
