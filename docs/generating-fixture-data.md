## Generating fixture data

Fixture data can be generated by following these steps:

1. Load the unpacked extension in development or test mode
2. Inspecting the background context of the extension
3. Call `stateHooks.metamaskGetState`, then call [`copy`][1] on the results

You can then paste the contents directly in your fixture file.

```js
copy(await stateHooks.metamaskGetState())
```
