# Environment example notes

When updating `.env.example` (or similar templates):

- Keep placeholders obvious (e.g., `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`)
- Never include real keys, tokens, or private endpoints
- Group variables by feature area
- Add brief inline comments for non-obvious fields

If you introduce a new required variable, document:
- where it is used
- acceptable values
- safe default (if any)
