  # three years.
  - 'popper.js (deprecation)'

  # React-router is out of date and brings in the following deprecated package
  - 'mini-create-react-context (deprecation)'

  # The affected version, which is less than 7.0.0, is brought in by
  # ethereumjs-wallet version 0.6.5 used in the extension but only in a single
  # file app/scripts/account-import-strategies/index.js, which may be easy to
  # upgrade.
  - 'uuid (deprecation)'

  # @npmcli/move-file is brought in via CopyWebpackPlugin used in the storybook
  # main.js file, which can be upgraded to remove this dependency in favor of
  # @npmcli/fs
  - '@npmcli/move-file (deprecation)'

  # Upgrading babel will result in the following deprecated packages being
  # updated:
  - 'core-js (deprecation)'

  # Material UI dependencies are planned for removal
  - '@material-ui/core (deprecation)'
  - '@material-ui/styles (deprecation)'
  - '@material-ui/system (deprecation)'

  # @ensdomains/ens should be explored for upgrade. The following packages are
  # deprecated and would be resolved by upgrading to newer versions of
  # ensdomains packages:
  - '@ensdomains/ens (deprecation)'
  - '@ensdomains/resolver (deprecation)'
  - 'testrpc (deprecation)'

  # Dependencies brought in by @truffle/decoder that are deprecated:
  - 'cids (deprecation)' # via @ensdomains/content-hash
  - 'multibase (deprecation)' # via cids
  - 'multicodec (deprecation)' # via cids

  # MetaMask owned repositories brought in by other MetaMask dependencies that
  # can be resolved by updating the versions throughout the dependency tree
  - 'eth-sig-util (deprecation)' # via @metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring
  - '@metamask/controller-utils (deprecation)' # via @metamask/phishin-controller
  - 'safe-event-emitter (deprecation)' # via eth-block-tracker and others

  # other dependencies. At the time of this exclusion, the extension has three
  # old versions of ethereumjs-utils which should be upgraded to
  # @ethereumjs/utils throughout our owned repositories. However even doing
  # that may be insufficient due to dependencies we do not own still relying
  # upon old versions of ethereumjs-utils.
  - 'ethereum-cryptography (deprecation)'
