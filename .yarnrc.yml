  ### Advisories:

  # Issue: yargs-parser Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
  # URL - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p9pc-299p-vxgp
  # The affected version (<5.0.0) is only included via @ensdomains/ens via
  # 'solc' which is not used in the imports we use from this package.

  # Issue: protobufjs Prototype Pollution vulnerability
  # URL - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h755-8qp9-cq85
  # Not easily patched. Minimally effects the extension due to usage of
  # LavaMoat lockdown. Additional id added that resolves to the same advisory
  # but has a different entry due to it being a new dependency of
  # @trezor/connect-web. Upgrading

  # Issue: Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDOS)
  # URL: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-257v-vj4p-3w2h
  # color-string is listed as a dependency of 'color' which is brought in by
  # @metamask/jazzicon v2.0.0 but there is work done on that repository to
  # remove the color dependency. We should upgrade
  - 1089718

  # Issue: semver vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
  # URL: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw
  # semver is used in the solidity compiler portion of @truffle/codec that does
  # not appear to be used.
  - 1092461

  # Issue: path-to-regexp outputs backtracking regular expressions
  # URL: https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wv6-86v2-598j
  # path-to-regexp is used in react-router v5.1.2, which we use. However, the
  # vulnerability in path-to-regexp could only be exploited within react-router
  # if malicious properties were passed to react-router components or methods
  # explicitly from our code. As such, this vulneratibility cannot be exploited
  # by an external / malicious actor. Meanwhile, once we update to v6+,
  # path-to-regexp will no longer be used.

  # Temp fix for https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/16920 for the sake of 11.7.1 hotfix
  # This will be removed in this ticket https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/22299

  ### Package Deprecations:

  # React-tippy brings in popper.js and react-tippy has not been updated in
  # three years.
  - 'popper.js (deprecation)'

  # React-router is out of date and brings in the following deprecated package
  - 'mini-create-react-context (deprecation)'

  # The affected version, which is less than 7.0.0, is brought in by
  # ethereumjs-wallet version 0.6.5 used in the extension but only in a single
  # file app/scripts/account-import-strategies/index.js, which may be easy to
  # upgrade.
  - 'uuid (deprecation)'

  # @npmcli/move-file is brought in via CopyWebpackPlugin used in the storybook
  # main.js file, which can be upgraded to remove this dependency in favor of
  # @npmcli/fs
  - '@npmcli/move-file (deprecation)'

  # Upgrading babel will result in the following deprecated packages being
  # updated:
  - 'core-js (deprecation)'

  # Material UI dependencies are planned for removal
  - '@material-ui/core (deprecation)'
  - '@material-ui/styles (deprecation)'
  - '@material-ui/system (deprecation)'

  # @ensdomains/ens should be explored for upgrade. The following packages are
  # deprecated and would be resolved by upgrading to newer versions of
  # ensdomains packages:
  - '@ensdomains/ens (deprecation)'
  - '@ensdomains/resolver (deprecation)'
  - 'testrpc (deprecation)'

  # Dependencies brought in by @truffle/decoder that are deprecated:
  - 'cids (deprecation)' # via @ensdomains/content-hash

  - 'multicodec (deprecation)' # via cids

  # MetaMask owned repositories brought in by other MetaMask dependencies that
  # can be resolved by updating the versions throughout the dependency tree
  - 'eth-sig-util (deprecation)' # via @metamask/eth-ledger-bridge-keyring
  - '@metamask/controller-utils (deprecation)' # via @metamask/phishing-controller
  - 'safe-event-emitter (deprecation)' # via eth-block-tracker and others

  # Brought in by ethereumjs-utils, which is used in the extension and in many
  # other dependencies. At the time of this exclusion, the extension has three
  # old versions of ethereumjs-utils which should be upgraded to
  # @ethereumjs/utils throughout our owned repositories. However even doing
  # that may be insufficient due to dependencies we do not own still relying
  # upon old versions of ethereumjs-utils.
  - 'ethereum-cryptography (deprecation)'

  # Currently only dependent on deprecated @metamask/types as it is brought in
  # by @metamask/keyring-api. Updating the dependency in keyring-api will
