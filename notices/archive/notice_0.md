Dear Nifty Wallet Users,

Nifty Wallet is beta software. 

When you log in to Nifty Wallet, your current account's address is visible to every new site you visit. This can be used to look up your account balances of Ether and other tokens.

For your privacy, for now, please sign out of Nifty Wallet when you're done using a site.

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake Nifty Wallet window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. Nifty Wallet will never open itself in this way.
