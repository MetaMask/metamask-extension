Dear Nifty Wallet Users,

There have been several instances of high-profile legitimate websites such as BTC Manager and Games Workshop that have had their websites temporarily compromised. This involves showing a fake Nifty Wallet window on the page asking for user's seed phrases. Nifty Wallet will never open itself in this way.
