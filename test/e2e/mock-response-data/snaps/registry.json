        "description": "The Push Snap is a MetaMask wallet enhancement that allows you to receive real-time notification alerts of your favourite web3 applications directly in your MetaMask wallet.\n\nAdd to MetaMask now.\n\n--\n\nTerms to know:\n\n- Channels: Channels simply represent any protocol or dapp that's activated itself on Push protocol and has the capability of sending notifications. For instance, Uniswap, ENS, Lens Protocol etc. are channels on Push Protocol that you can opt-in to.\n- Notifications: Notifications are alerts from any of the channels that user opts-in to. For example, loan liquidation alerts, new governance proposals, ENS domain name expiry or web3 news updates.\n\n—-Web3 users often interact with a plethora of decentralized applications (dapps) ranging from DeFi tools, to NFT marketplaces to media channels. With so many dapps, staying updated often demands constant attention and regular logins, resulting in an overwhelming user experience.\n\nThe Push Snap aims to resolve this issue by bringing all essential updates for the user directly into their MetaMask wallet. This eliminates the need to bounce between multiple web3 applications as the user's MetaMask wallet now acts as a unified notification center for all imperative web3 updates.\n\nGet Started in 4-Simple Steps\n\n1. Installation: Click on 'Add to MetaMask' button shown above. This initiates the process of adding the Push Snap to your MetaMask wallet.\n2. Setting-Up Push Snap: Once installed, you should be prompted to visit Push dapp, i.e., https://app.push.org/snap. Visit the dapp to proceed with next steps.\n3. Adding your Address: Once connected to the dapp, the Snap will require confirmation to add your address. Adding of address in the Snap means enabling your wallet to receive notifications.\n4. Opt-In to Channels: Once address is added, simply click on Get Started. This takes you to https://app.push.org/channels wherein you can opt-in to any of your favorite channels to receive real-time notifications.\n\nVideo Walk-through\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjPxKoYLiGs\n\nAdditional Features of Push Snap\n\n1. Address Selection: Users can add or remove their preferred addresses to the snap for notification whenever they want.\n2. Customization of Pop-Ups: Push Snap also allows users to toggle popup notifications at their convenience.",

The platform has mapped 500 blockchains, scored more than 270,000 wallets, and identified over 1,000 virtual asset service providers (VASPs). This expertise underpins the reliability and accuracy of the SafeTransfer Snap.\n\nTo use the Snap, simply initiate a transaction in MetaMask as usual. The Scorechain Tab will appear automatically, providing detailed insights into the risk level of the transaction. Review the information and decide whether to proceed or cancel.\n\nFor any questions or feedback, you can reach out to the Scorechain support team at support@scorechain.com.

This transaction is an EIP-712 type, but on MetaMask’s signature popup, critical information like “from” and “to” addresses is displayed in an unintuitive format (e.g., uint256).\n\nThe Snap’s key purpose is to decode these fields into a more readable format, making it easier for users to understand the transaction details they’re signing. Additionally, it provides extra information related to the paymaster, such as the paymaster address, type, gas fee token address, and gas fee token amount. This gives users more clarity on what they’re signing, helping them avoid potential malicious signatures.",

It leverages Noves's industry-leading translation engine for smart contracts, providing extensive coverage across 50+ chains and hundreds of millions of smart contracts.\n\nHow it works:\n\nWhen you initiate a transaction, and before you sign it, Noves Foresight will perform a simulation of the transaction that will calculate all of the asset transfers that would take place. It will then translate the raw simulation into something easy to understand, including:\n\n- An English sentence that describes the real-world meaning of the transaction. For example:  'This transaction will claim 10 CRV in rewards' or 'This transaction will add 1 ETH and 4000 USDC to a liquidity pool.'\n\n- A fully-tagged 'flow' view of all the asset transfers that will take place. You'll be able to easily see why a particular token is coming in or out of your wallet.\n\nHow to use:\n\nIt's super simple! Just check out the 'Noves Foresight' tab in your MetaMask prompt, any time you've initiated a transaction and want to check what's going to happen before you sign.",

The Nocturne MetaMask Snap stores and manages this spending key.\n\nNocturne Spending Key Derivation\nDuring the first user onboarding flow, the user is prompted to sign a fixed message. The produced signature serves as the user's spending key and is stored in the Nocturne Snap. After being stored, the key never leaves the Nocturne Snap and is only accessed by the Snap for producing signatures.\n\nRegistering Your Canonical Address\nA canonical Nocturne address is a public address that can be used to generate more Nocturne stealth addresses that belong to the owner of the corresponding Nocturne spending key. One of the last steps in the user-onboarding flow is for the user to register their canonical Nocturne address against their public Ethereum address to facilitate a convenient mapping. The Nocturne Snap will prompt the user to sign a message proving that they own the canonical Nocturne address. After that, the user generates a ZKP of the signature and then submits it to the canonical address registry contract to link their Nocturne address to their public wallet.\n\nSigning Operations\nAll operations that spend private funds, (transferring ETH to a fresh address, performing a private swap, etc) must be authorized from your Nocturne spending key. When a user wants to perform an operation, the Nocturne Snap will prompt the user to confirm they would like to authorize the operation. If the user hits 'Confirm,' the Snap will sign the operation with the user's spending key, authorizing the operation.",

        "description": "The EAS Snap enhances the transparency and security of EAS attestations signed with your MetaMask. It decodes attestation data, allowing users to clearly understand and verify the details before confirming a transaction.\n\nWhy It Matters\nWhen signing attestations with MetaMask, the data often appears in a hexadecimal format, which is not human-readable. The EAS Snap converts this data into a clear, readable format. This ensures you're fully aware of the attestation's details, mitigating the risk of unintentional or malicious signings.\n\nKey Features\n- Attestation Decoding: Utilizes SchemaEncoder from the EAS SDK to decode attestation data, presenting it in a readable format.\n- Transaction Data Parsing: The snap parses Ethereum transaction data to identify if it is related to an EAS attestation, using ethers library.\n- Dynamic Content Rendering: It dynamically renders transaction details in the MetaMask UI, including schema, recipient, reference UID, expiration time, and revocability status, offering users a complete overview of the attestation they are about to sign.\n- Time Formatting: Utilizes dayjs with extended formats to display expiration times in a user-friendly manner.\n- GraphQL Integration: Communicates with EAS's GraphQL endpoint to fetch and display the schema associated with the attestation.\n- Data Decoding and Display: Decodes and displays each piece of attestation data using the fetched schema, allowing users to understand the specifics of what they are attesting.\n\nAfter installing the Snap, you can view insights in the transaction flow while interacting with an EAS contract.

Using this Snap, users of accounts, inside MetaMask, would still have pure self-custody (all key shards are under user control and possession), while the key shards are distributed between their browser wallet and phone. \n\nSilent Shard enables an experience where the user is requested to approve transactions on their paired phone. This brings the user flow of the web3 wallet closer and more conforming to conventional 2FA, which is well accepted in traditional internet banking and fintech applications. \n\nThe Snap supports features like instant backup and recovery, and transaction security insights are to come. You can now bid goodbye to a seed phrase as a single point of failure and enjoy a fully decentralised experience.",

        "description": "This Snap utilizes the ring signature implementation from Cypher Lab to privately sign messages. The signature can then be verified by any third party without revealing the actual signer.\n\nIt supports two types of ring signatures: Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures (SAG) and Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signatures (LSAG). If you are using the SAG scheme, no one will ever know that you signed the message. Use the LSAG scheme if you want third parties to know you signed multiple messages without revealing your identity.\n\nFeatures:\n- Create an Ethereum account\n- Import an Ethereum account using a mnemonic\n- Export the snap addresses\n- Sign a message using SAG and LSAG with the snap\n- Verify a SAG or LSAG signature\n\nWhat are Ring Signatures?\nRing signatures are a type of digital signature that allows a group of users to sign a message anonymously. Unlike traditional digital signatures uniquely linked to one user, ring signatures obscure the actual author by linking multiple possible signers together in a “ring.”\n\nRing signatures preserve privacy and anonymity by obscuring the specific originator of a message. By grouping possible signers in a “ring,” there is no way to definitively pinpoint the actual individual who authored the content. This prevents transactions from being easily traced back to a single user. The larger the ring of possible signers, the more anonymity is provided to the real originator.\n\nRing signatures have been known to cryptographers for several years, but their use within the blockchain ecosystem has been limited. The Monero blockchain is noted as one of the first to employ this cryptographic solution at the protocol level. However, there is currently no complete, robust, and audited implementation of ring signatures adapted for the browser environment. This is where we come in!\n\nUseful links:\n- More about ring signatures: https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RST01.pdf\n- SAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-SAG-TS\n- LSAG repository: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-LSAG-TS\n- Toolkit for integrating with dapps: https://github.com/Cypher-Laboratory/Alice-s-Ring-snap-toolkit",
