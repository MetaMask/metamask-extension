# Hardware Wallet Signing Flow (Batch + Sequential)

## Overview

Hardware wallet bridge/swap transactions use one of two tracking paths depending on whether Smart Transactions (STX) are enabled:

- **Batch path** (STX enabled): `addTransactionBatchWithHook` creates two transactions sharing a `batchId`, signed sequentially, submitted as a bundle via `sendBundle`.
- **Sequential path** (STX disabled): `addTransaction` creates approval and trade as independent transactions with no `batchId`, submitted sequentially via standard `eth_sendRawTransaction`.

The `hardware-wallet-signatures.tsx` component selects the appropriate tracker at render time using `getIsStxEnabled`.

## Path Selection

```
hardware-wallet-signatures.tsx
  │
  ├── useSelector(getIsStxEnabled) → isStxEnabled
  │
  ├── useHwBatchSignTracker(..., { enabled: isStxEnabled })
  │     Active when STX is enabled
  │     Tracks events by batchId
  │
  ├── useHwSequentialSignTracker(..., { enabled: !isStxEnabled })
  │     Active when STX is disabled
  │     Tracks events by tx ID
  │
  └── cancelCurrentBatch = isStxEnabled ? cancelBatch : cancelSequential
```

Both hooks are always called (React rules of hooks), but only one subscribes to events based on its `enabled` flag. The inactive hook is a no-op.

## Full Submission Flow

## Retry Flow (Unified)

All retry scenarios (Disconnected, Rejected, Failed) use a single `handleRetry` function with identical logic. There are no separate retry paths.

```
State = Rejected/Failed/Disconnected → User clicks retry button
  │
  ▼
handleRetry (unified):
  isRetryingRef = true           ← blocks stale HW callbacks from old batch
  hasRetriedRef = true           ← enables "Resend transaction" button later
  setIsRetrying(true)
  │
  retryGenerationRef += 1        ← signal useHwBatchSignTracker to stale old batch IDs
  │
  await cancelCurrentBatch()     ← aborts all tracked tx IDs via abortTransactionSigning RPC
  │                               ← waits up to 5s for abort events to settle
  │
  Check connection status:
    Allowed: Connected, Ready, AwaitingConfirmation, ErrorState
    If not allowed → return early (no state dispatch, no retry)
  │
  retryGenerationRef += 1        ← second increment for new batch tracking
  resetConnectionError()         ← clears handledConnectionErrorRef + isDeviceDisconnectedRef
  dispatch Reset(needsTwoConf)   → AwaitingFirst or AwaitingFinal (fresh state)
  │
  await retrySubmission()
    │
    ▼
  submitBridgeTransaction(lockedQuote, { rpcTimeoutMs: 120_000 })
    │  Extended RPC timeout for retries (120s vs default)
    │  ensureDeviceReady() called if connectionState !== Ready
    │
    │  dispatch(submitBridgeTx(...))
    │  → new batch created with new batchId
    │  → old batch events filtered by staleBatchIdsRef
    │
    ▼
  isRetryingRef = false
  setIsRetrying(false)
  │
  ▼
  User signs approve (if needed) → trade → Submitted
```

**Key behaviors:**
- **`cancelCurrentBatch()`** aborts all tracked transactions before retrying. This ensures the old batch is cleanly terminated in the background.
- **`isRetryingRef`** prevents stale HW callbacks (`onHardwareWalletSubmitted`/`Rejected`/`Failed`) from the old batch from transitioning the state machine during the retry.
- **Double `retryGenerationRef` increment**: First increment marks old batch IDs as stale before `cancelCurrentBatch`. Second increment after cancel ensures the new batch's events are correctly tracked.
- **Connection gating**: If the device is not connected (status is `Disconnected`), the retry returns early without dispatching any events. The user must reconnect first.
- **All retries use `Reset`** (not `Retry`). The state machine always returns to the initial state. The `Retry` event exists in the state machine but is **unused** by the current `handleRetry` implementation.

### Signature Stuck Timeout

After the user has retried at least once (`hasRetriedRef.current = true`), if the state machine remains in an awaiting-signature state for more than `SIGNATURE_STUCK_TIMEOUT_MS` (5 seconds), a "Resend transaction" button appears. This allows the user to retry again without waiting for an explicit failure.

The timeout resets when:
- The state leaves awaiting-signature (Submitted/Rejected/Failed/Disconnected)
- A retry is in flight (`isRetrying = true`)

### Cancel Button

The Cancel button always:
1. Calls `cancelCurrentBatch()` to abort tracked transactions
2. Calls `handleQrSignatureCancel()` to reject QR scan if active
3. Navigates back to the bridge page

## State Machine

```
needsTwoConfirmations=true (quote has approval):
  AwaitingFirstSignature ──FirstSignatureSubmitted──▶ AwaitingFinalSignature
                                                       │
                     TransactionSubmitted ◀─────────────┘
                     TransactionRejected → Rejected(rejectedSignature)
                     TransactionFailed → Failed(failedSignature)
                     DeviceDisconnected → Disconnected(disconnectedSignature)

needsTwoConfirmations=false (no approval):
  AwaitingFinalSignature
    TransactionSubmitted → Submitted
    TransactionRejected → Rejected(rejectedSignature)
    TransactionFailed → Failed(failedSignature)
    DeviceDisconnected → Disconnected(disconnectedSignature)

Terminal/resumable states:
  Reset → returns to initial state (AwaitingFirst or AwaitingFinal based on needsTwoConfirmations)
```

The state machine is a pure reducer (`hardwareWalletSignaturesReducer`) with no platform dependencies. See `STATE-MACHINE.md` for the full transition table and diagram.

## Stale Event Filtering

### Batch Path: `useHwBatchSignTracker`

Uses a 3-state `currentBatchIdRef` to prevent stale events from old batches (created before a retry) from causing false state transitions:

```
┌─────────────┐   first signed event   ┌─────────────┐
│ undefined   │ ──────────────────────▶ │ "batch-123" │
│ (accept all)│                         │ (match only)│
└─────────────┘                         └──────┬──────┘
      ▲                                        │
      │  retryGenerationRef changed             │
      │                                        │
┌─────┴───────┐◀───────────────────────────────┘
│ null        │  retry: reset to null,
│ (block all) │  block rejection/finished events
└─────────────┘  until new batch's first signed event
                  sets the new batchId
```

**State meanings:**
- `undefined` — Initial state, no batch seen yet. Accept all events (first submission). Rejection/finished events are blocked in this state (`shouldBlockPendingEvent` returns true).
- `null` — Retry triggered via `retryGenerationRef` change. Block all rejection/finished events to prevent stale batch events from causing false failures. Only `signed` events pass through (and they set the new batchId). Stale batch IDs from previous batches are tracked in `staleBatchIdsRef` Set.
- `"batch-xxx"` — Active batch identified. Only accept events matching this batchId.

**Why this matters:** When the user retries after rejection/failure/disconnect, a new batch is created. The old batch's `transactionRejected`/`transactionFinished` events may still arrive asynchronously. Without filtering, these stale events would immediately transition the state machine back to Rejected/Failed, preventing the retry from succeeding.

### Sequential Path: `useHwSequentialSignTracker`

Uses a `Set<string>` of tracked tx IDs to correlate events. Simpler than batch tracking:

1. When `transactionStatusUpdated` fires for a matching tx (fromAddress + type), the tx ID is added to `trackedTxIdsRef`
2. `transactionRejected` and `transactionFinished` events only dispatch if the tx ID is in `trackedTxIdsRef`
3. On retry (`retryGenerationRef` change), `trackedTxIdsRef` is cleared — old tx IDs become untracked, so stale events are silently ignored

**Key difference from batch tracker:** No initial blocking of rejection/finished events. Events dispatch if the tx ID was previously tracked via `transactionStatusUpdated`. This works because `transactionStatusUpdated` fires with `status: 'unapproved'` when a tx is created, which happens before the user can reject it.

## cancelCurrentBatch

Both trackers return a `cancelCurrentBatch` function with the same interface. The active one is selected based on `isStxEnabled`. The function:

Both trackers' `cancelCurrentBatch` works identically:

1. Collects all tracked tx IDs from `trackedTxIdsRef`
2. Clears the tracked set
3. Calls `abortTransactionSigning` RPC for each tx ID (via `submitRequestToBackground`)
4. Tracks pending abort IDs in `pendingAbortTxIdsRef`
5. Waits up to 5 seconds for abort events to settle (via `abortSettleResolveRef`)

**Event filtering during abort:** All three event subscriptions check `pendingAbortTxIdsRef`. If an event's tx ID is in the pending abort set:
- The tx ID is removed from the pending set
- If all pending aborts have settled, the abort promise is resolved
- The event is NOT dispatched to the state machine

This prevents abort-triggered events from causing false state transitions.

## isRetryingRef Guard

`handleRetry` sets `isRetryingRef.current = true` before starting the retry and `false` in the `finally` block. The HW callback handlers (`handleHardwareWalletSubmitted`, `handleHardwareWalletRejected`, `handleHardwareWalletFailed`) check this ref and return early if retrying:

```typescript
if (isRetryingRef.current) {
  return;
}
```

This prevents errors from the old batch's `submitBridgeTransaction` promise (which may still be in flight) from racing with the retry and prematurely transitioning the state machine.

## Trezor WebUSB Workaround

The component calls `setSigningInProgress(true)` from `useHardwareWalletActions()` while:
- `hasStartedSubmission.current` is true AND state is awaiting-signature

And `setSigningInProgress(false)` when:
- State is terminal (Submitted/Rejected/Failed/Disconnected)
- Component unmounts

This suppresses spurious WebUSB disconnect teardowns during Trezor signing sessions. See `isSigningInProgressRef` in `HardwareWalletStateManager` for details.

## Critical Details

**Why not Redux/polling for batch status:**
`TransactionController` is NOT in `memStore` (metamask-controller.js:1397+), so its state never arrives in Redux via the patch-store substream. The event-driven approach via `useHwBatchSignTracker` subscribing directly to `TransactionController` messenger events is more reliable and immediate than polling.

**Why not 7702 for HW wallets:**
`bridge-status-controller-init.ts:44-51` forces `disable7702=true` and clears gas sponsorship for non-7702 accounts (including HW wallets). This routes through `addTransactionBatchWithHook` instead of `addTransactionBatchWith7702`, creating separate transactions instead of a single batch tx.

**Controller-side batch failure cleanup:**
`@metamask/transaction-controller@65.0.0` fixes the orphaned publish-hook retry
case by waiting for each nested batch tx to reach `signed`/`submitted`/
`confirmed` before moving to the next one, and rejecting immediately when a
member reaches `failed` or `rejected`. This lets the controller reject held
publish promises and run `wipeTransactionBatchById(batchId)`, so the UI no
longer cancels stale `unapproved` batch txs before retrying.

**How the step-1→step-2 transition works:**

Batch path (`useHwBatchSignTracker`):
- Subscribes to three `TransactionController` messenger events
- Filters by `fromAddress` match + batch type (bridgeApproval/swapApproval/bridge/swap) + batch ID (when known)
- Stale batch filtering uses a `Set<string>` (`staleBatchIdsRef`) to track all seen batch IDs that become stale on retry
- `TransactionController:transactionStatusUpdated` — detects `status=signed` + approval type → `FirstSignatureSubmitted`. Also detects `status=failed` → `TransactionFailed`
- `TransactionController:transactionRejected` — detects tx rejection on batch txs → `TransactionRejected` (skipped if stale batch)
- `TransactionController:transactionFinished` — detects `status=rejected` or `status=failed` → `TransactionRejected` or `TransactionFailed` (skipped if stale batch)

Sequential path (`useHwSequentialSignTracker`):
- Subscribes to the same three `TransactionController` messenger events
- Filters by `fromAddress` match + batch type (same as batch tracker)
- Tracks tx IDs in `trackedTxIdsRef` Set — only dispatches rejection/finished events if the tx ID was previously tracked
- On retry (`retryGenerationRef` change), clears the tracked set to ignore stale events
- Same dispatch logic: approval signed → `FirstSignatureSubmitted`, trade signed → `TransactionSubmitted`

Note: `transactionStatusUpdated` does NOT fire for rejections with `status=rejected`. The controller emits `transactionRejected` and `transactionFinished` separately for those. `transactionStatusUpdated` with `status=failed` does fire for failures.

**Quote data preservation:**
`useHwSwapQuoteData` uses `lockedQuoteRef` (not `activeQuote`) to survive debounced `sendUpdate` clearing the quotes list mid-flow. All rendering and effects use `lockedQuote` instead of `activeQuote`.

**Background routing (line 656 of bridge-status-controller.mjs):**
1. `isStxEnabledOnClient` — Smart Transactions enabled (sendBundle) → batch path
2. `quoteResponse.quote.gasIncluded7702` — Gasless 7702 flow → batch path (always `false` for HW)
3. `isDelegatedAccount` — EIP-7702 delegated account → batch path

If none are true, falls through to sequential non-batch path (approve → trade as separate `addTransaction` calls), with NO `batchId`.

**Sequential path (STX disabled, non-batch):**
No `batchId` exists. The background handles approve + swap as separate sequential transactions via `submitEvmTransaction` → `addTransaction`. Both txs go through the confirmation system. The approval tx is fully processed (signed + published) before the trade tx is created (the RPC blocks on each `addTransaction` call). `useHwSequentialSignTracker` tracks these by tx ID instead of batch ID.

**ErrorCode import:**
`useHwSwapConnectionMonitoring` imports `ErrorCode` directly from `@metamask/hw-wallet-sdk`, NOT from the barrel export at `ui/contexts/hardware-wallets/index.ts` (which does not re-export it).

**Intent data not supported for HW wallets:**
If `quoteResponse.quote.intent` exists and `hardwareWalletUsed` is true, `submitBridgeTransaction` calls `onHardwareWalletFailed` and returns without submitting. Intent-based quotes require off-chain signing not supported by hardware wallets.

**RPC timeout for retries:**
`retrySubmission` passes `{ rpcTimeoutMs: 120_000 }` (120 seconds) to `submitBridgeTransaction`. The initial submission has no timeout. The timeout is implemented via `Promise.race` between the RPC call and a timeout promise.

**Error classification in submitBridgeTransaction:**
User rejections are detected via `isHardwareWalletUserRejection()` which checks:
- `isUserRejectedHardwareWalletError()` (standard error codes)
- Trezor: message includes "cancelled" or "rejected"
- Lattice: message includes "rejected"
- Generic: "user rejected" or "user cancelled"

User rejection → `onHardwareWalletRejected`. All other errors → `onHardwareWalletFailed`.

4. UI shows "Reconnect your device and try again"
   + "Reconnect and try again" button
      │
      ▼
5. User reconnects cable, clicks "Reconnect and try again"
      │

6. handleRetry (unified path):
    isRetryingRef = true
    retryGenerationRef += 1 (first increment, stales old batch IDs)
    await cancelCurrentBatch() → aborts tracked txs
    connectionState check → Connected/Ready → proceed
    retryGenerationRef += 1 (second increment for new batch)
    resetConnectionError() → clear handledConnectionErrorRef + isDeviceDisconnectedRef
    Reset → AwaitingFirst/Final
    retrySubmission() → submitBridgeTransaction with { rpcTimeoutMs: 120_000 }
       │
       ▼
7. submitBridgeTransaction calls ensureDeviceReady()
    → Sends preflight commands (getFeatures/checkApp/blindSigning)
    → dispatches submitBridgeTx → NEW batch created
      │
      ▼
8. useHwBatchSignTracker:
   retryGenerationRef changed → currentBatchIdRef = null
   Old batch events blocked (null = reject all)
   First signed event from new batch → sets new batchId
      │
      ▼
9. User signs approve → FirstSignatureSubmitted
   User signs trade → TransactionSubmitted → toast + navigate

Note: If device not actually reconnected at step 5-6, the connection
status check (Connected/Ready/AwaitingConfirmation/ErrorState) will fail
and handleRetry returns early without retrying.

## Maintenance

If any file in the Key Files table or the flow described above is modified, **update this AGENTS.md** to keep it accurate. Specifically:
- Changes to `useHwBatchSignTracker.ts`, `useHwSequentialSignTracker.ts`, or the state machine
- Changes to any hook in `ui/hooks/swap/hardware-wallets/` (`useHwSwapQuoteData`, `useHwSwapSubmission`, `useHwSwapConnectionMonitoring`, `useHwSwapConfirmationMonitoring`, `useHwSwapQrState`, `useHwSwapNavigation`)
- Changes to the batch path logic in `bridge-status-controller` or `transaction-controller`
- Changes to the sequential path logic (non-batch `addTransaction` flow)
- Changes to how the component selects between batch and sequential trackers (`getIsStxEnabled`)
- Changes to the `addTransactionBatchFn` wrapper in `bridge-status-controller-init.ts`
- New transaction types or status values that affect the approval/trade detection logic
- Changes to how STX/7702/delegation routing works in `BridgeStatusController.submitTx`
- Changes to `submitBridgeTransaction` options (e.g., `rpcTimeoutMs`)
- Changes to retry behavior in `handleRetry` or `retrySubmission`
- Changes to `cancelCurrentBatch` abort logic or timeout
- Changes to `SIGNATURE_STUCK_TIMEOUT_MS` or the stuck retry button behavior
- Changes to `isRetryingRef` guard logic
- Changes to Trezor `setSigningInProgress` workaround
- Re-introduction of a `Retry`/resume event to the state machine (currently removed)
