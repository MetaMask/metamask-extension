# MetaMask Translation

MetaMaskTranslation is a simple helper component for adding full translation
support to the template system. We do pass the translation function to the
template getValues function, but passing it React components as variables
would require React to be in scope, and breaks the object pattern paradigm.

This component gets around that by converting variables that are templates
themselves into tiny React trees. This component does additional validation
to make sure that the tree has a single root node, with maximum two leaves.
Each subnode can have a maximum of one child that must be a string.

This enforces a maximum recursion depth of 2, preventing translation strings
from being performance hogs. We could further limit this, and also attenuate
the safeComponentList for what kind of components we allow these special
trees to contain.
