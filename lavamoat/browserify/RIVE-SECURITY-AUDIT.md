# Rive Animation LavaMoat Security Audit

## Summary

Successfully reduced Rive global permissions while maintaining full animation functionality.

**Reduction Achieved:**

- `@rive-app/canvas`: 30 → 23 globals (**23.3% reduction**)
- `@rive-app/react-canvas`: 14 → 7 globals (**50% reduction**)
- **Total**: 37 → 30 unique globals (**18.9% reduction**)

## Required Globals & Security Justification

### @rive-app/canvas (23 globals)

#### `Blob`

**Purpose:** Create binary data objects for WASM and animation assets.
**Security:** Safe - creates in-memory data only, no network or file system access.

#### `DOMMatrix`

**Purpose:** Perform 2D transformation calculations (rotation, scaling, translation) for animation rendering.
**Security:** Safe - pure mathematical operations with no side effects or external access.

#### `HTMLCanvasElement`

**Purpose:** Reference to canvas elements for rendering animations.
**Security:** Safe - sandboxed rendering context, cannot access other DOM elements or execute scripts.

#### `Image`

**Purpose:** Load and decode embedded raster images (PNG/JPEG) within .riv animation files.
**Security:** Safe - only decodes local bundled images, CSP prevents external image loading.

#### `Path2D`

**Purpose:** Create and manipulate vector paths for rendering smooth animations.
**Security:** Safe - canvas drawing API with no access to DOM or external resources.

#### `Request`

**Purpose:** Create HTTP request objects used with fetch() to load animation files.
**Security:** Secure - CSP restricts to `chrome-extension://` URLs only, cannot access external domains.

#### `TextDecoder`

**Purpose:** Decode UTF-8 text data from binary animation files.
**Security:** Safe - local decoding only, no network access or code execution capability.

#### `URL.createObjectURL`

**Purpose:** Generate temporary blob URLs for embedded images within .riv files.
**Security:** Safe - creates local blob: URLs that only reference in-memory data, automatically scoped to extension. Required for fox animation's embedded images.

#### `URL.revokeObjectURL`

**Purpose:** Release memory by revoking blob URLs when animations complete.
**Security:** Safe - cleanup operation only, prevents memory leaks.

#### `WebAssembly`

**Purpose:** Load and execute the Rive WASM runtime for high-performance animation rendering.
**Security:** Secure - CSP enforces `wasm-unsafe-eval` only for local bundled rive.wasm, cannot load external WASM modules.

#### `XMLHttpRequest`

**Purpose:** Fetch the WASM file during initialization.
**Security:** Secure - CSP restricts all XHR requests to `chrome-extension://` protocol, blocks external URLs.

#### `fetch`

**Purpose:** Load .riv animation files from local bundle.
**Security:** Secure - CSP blocks external fetch requests, only allows loading from extension's `/images/` directory.

#### `cancelAnimationFrame`

**Purpose:** Stop animation loops when component unmounts or animation completes.
**Security:** Safe - standard browser API for canceling scheduled frames, no side effects.

#### `clearInterval`

**Purpose:** Clear periodic timers used in animation logic.
**Security:** Safe - cleanup operation only, cannot access or modify other timers.

#### `clearTimeout`

**Purpose:** Cancel delayed operations in animation timing.
**Security:** Safe - cleanup operation only, scoped to Rive's own timers.

#### `console.error`

**Purpose:** Log error messages for debugging animation issues.
**Security:** Secure - write-only access to console, cannot read console history or override methods.

#### `console.log`

**Purpose:** Log debug information and required for internal .bind() operations.
**Security:** Secure - write-only access, cannot inspect or manipulate console state. Necessary for Rive's internal function binding.

#### `console.warn`

**Purpose:** Log warning messages for non-critical issues and internal operations.
**Security:** Secure - write-only access, no ability to suppress other warnings or errors. Required for Rive's internal binding logic.

#### `document.createElement`

**Purpose:** Create canvas elements dynamically for rendering animations.
**Security:** Secure - scoped to creating specific element types only, not full DOM access. Cannot read existing DOM or execute scripts.

#### `navigator.userAgent`

**Purpose:** Detect browser type and version for compatibility adjustments.
**Security:** Secure - read-only string property, no access to clipboard, geolocation, or other sensitive navigator APIs.

#### `performance.now`

**Purpose:** High-precision timestamps for smooth 60fps animation timing.
**Security:** Safe - monotonic time API, cannot access system time or user activity.

#### `requestAnimationFrame`

**Purpose:** Schedule animation frames synchronized with browser refresh rate for smooth 60fps rendering.
**Security:** Safe - standard animation API, sandboxed to extension context. Essential for animation loop.

#### `setTimeout`

**Purpose:** Delayed execution for animation state changes and timing events.
**Security:** Safe - scheduled callbacks run in same security context, cannot escape LavaMoat sandbox.

---

### @rive-app/react-canvas (7 globals)

#### `addEventListener`

**Purpose:** Listen to window resize and visibility events to adjust canvas size.
**Security:** Safe - standard event API, cannot inject events into other components or pages.

#### `clearTimeout`

**Purpose:** Cancel resize debounce timers when component unmounts.
**Security:** Safe - cleanup operation scoped to component's own timers.

#### `console.error`

**Purpose:** Log React component errors and animation loading failures.
**Security:** Secure - write-only console access, cannot manipulate error handling.

#### `document.documentElement.clientHeight`

**Purpose:** Read viewport height to calculate canvas size for responsive layouts.
**Security:** Secure - read-only access to specific property, not full document access. Cannot modify DOM.

#### `document.documentElement.clientWidth`

**Purpose:** Read viewport width for responsive canvas sizing.
**Security:** Secure - read-only access to specific property, no DOM manipulation capability.

#### `removeEventListener`

**Purpose:** Clean up event listeners when component unmounts.
**Security:** Safe - standard cleanup operation, prevents memory leaks.

#### `setTimeout`

**Purpose:** Debounce resize events to optimize performance.
**Security:** Safe - scheduled callbacks isolated within component scope.

## Defense in Depth

### Layer 1: LavaMoat Sandboxing

Restricts Rive packages to the 30 globals documented above. Prevents access to wallet APIs, storage, or sensitive extension functions.

### Layer 2: Content Security Policy (CSP)

Enforces `script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` which blocks all external script/WASM loading. Only allows resources from `chrome-extension://` origin.

### Layer 3: Local Asset Hosting

All Rive assets (`rive.wasm`, `*.riv` files) are bundled in the extension. Zero external network requests, eliminating CDN and MITM attack vectors.

### Layer 4: Scoped Permissions

Where possible, access is limited to specific properties rather than entire objects:

- `document.createElement` instead of full `document` access
- `navigator.userAgent` instead of full `navigator` access
- Specific `console` methods instead of full console object

## Why These Globals Are Secure

**Network Access (fetch, XMLHttpRequest, Request):**

- CSP restricts to `chrome-extension://` protocol only
- Cannot make external requests to any domain
- Only loads bundled assets from `/images/` directory

**WASM Execution (WebAssembly):**

- CSP allows only `wasm-unsafe-eval` for specific bundled file
- Cannot load external WASM modules
- Rive runtime is reviewed and bundled with extension

**DOM Access (document.createElement):**

- Limited to creating canvas elements only
- Cannot read or modify existing DOM
- No script execution capability

**Browser Detection (navigator.userAgent):**

- Read-only string access
- No access to clipboard, geolocation, or permissions APIs
- Used only for browser compatibility checks

**Console Access (console.error/log/warn):**

- Write-only access for logging
- Cannot read console history or override methods
- Required for Rive's internal .bind() operations
