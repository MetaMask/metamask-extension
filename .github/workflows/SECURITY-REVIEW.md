# Security Review - Release Process Workflows

## Security Audit Date: September 25, 2025

### Critical Security Fixes Applied

#### 1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
- **Issue**: User inputs (version, branch names) were used directly without validation
- **Risk**: Command injection, path traversal attacks
- **Fix**: Added strict regex validation for all user inputs
  - Version format: `^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?$`
  - Branch names: `^[a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]+$`
  - Prevents directory traversal patterns (`..`)

#### 2. **Information Disclosure Prevention**
- **Issue**: Sensitive commit SHAs exposed in error messages
- **Risk**: Information leakage that could aid attackers
- **Fix**: Moved detailed debug info to stderr logs only

#### 3. **Markdown Injection Prevention**
- **Issue**: Unescaped variables in PR descriptions
- **Risk**: Markdown/HTML injection in PR body
- **Fix**: Proper escaping of special markdown characters

#### 4. **Access Control**
- **Issue**: No restrictions on who can trigger workflows
- **Risk**: Unauthorized users could trigger release workflows
- **Fix**: Added bot exclusion checks
- **Recommendation**: Configure GitHub branch protection rules

#### 5. **Command Injection in Scripts**
- **Issue**: Unsanitized variables in shell commands
- **Risk**: Remote code execution
- **Fix**: Validated all inputs before use in shell commands

### Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Workflows use minimal required permissions
   - `contents: write` only when necessary for tagging
   - `pull-requests: write` only for PR operations

2. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs validated before use
   - Strict regex patterns for versions and branch names
   - No shell expansion of user-controlled variables

3. **Error Handling**
   - Sensitive information not exposed in error messages
   - Debug information logged to stderr only
   - Clear user-facing errors without technical details

4. **Secure Defaults**
   - `force-retag` defaults to false
   - Requires explicit action for dangerous operations
   - Protected against accidental tag moves

### Remaining Recommendations

1. **Enable Required Status Checks**
   ```yaml
   # In repository settings, make these required:
   - release/tag-check
   - release/tagged
   ```

2. **Restrict Workflow Permissions**
   - Configure GITHUB_TOKEN with minimal permissions
   - Use fine-grained PATs where needed
   - Rotate tokens regularly

3. **Add CODEOWNERS**
   ```
   # .github/CODEOWNERS
   .github/workflows/tag-release-*.yml @release-team
   .github/workflows/check-release-*.yml @release-team
   .github/workflows/publish-release.yml @release-team
   ```

4. **Enable Audit Logging**
   - Monitor workflow executions
   - Alert on failed authentication attempts
   - Track all tag creation/deletion events

5. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Require PR reviews for workflow changes
   - Restrict who can merge to master/stable
   - Prevent force pushes to protected branches

### Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with malicious version formats
- [ ] Test with path traversal in branch names
- [ ] Test with markdown injection in versions
- [ ] Verify error messages don't leak information
- [ ] Confirm workflows fail safely on invalid input
- [ ] Test with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Verify tag protection mechanisms

### Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:
1. Immediately disable affected workflows
2. Audit recent workflow runs for suspicious activity
3. Check git history for unauthorized tags/releases
4. Rotate all secrets and tokens
5. Apply fixes and re-enable with monitoring

### Regular Security Reviews

Schedule quarterly reviews to:
- Update input validation patterns
- Review permission scopes
- Audit workflow execution logs
- Update dependencies (actions/checkout, etc.)
- Review and rotate secrets
