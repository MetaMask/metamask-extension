# Release Process Alignment - Quick Summary for Approval

## The Change
**Tag release branch HEAD before merging to master** (instead of tagging the merge commit after)

## What This Solves
- **Current issue**: Tag is placed on merge commit, not the tested code
- **Solution**: Tag the exact code that QA tested, then merge it
- **Result**: Tagged commit becomes part of master's history

## Impact on Current Process
- **99% unchanged** - All existing workflows continue as-is
- **One new step** - Run "Tag Release Branch" workflow (< 1 minute)
- **When** - After QA approval, before merging

## Enforcement & Safety Mechanisms

### Automated Checks âœ…
1. **PR Check Workflow**: Verifies tag exists before allowing merge
2. **Status Check**: Shows warning if release not tagged
3. **PR Labels**: `release-tagged` label indicates completion
4. **PR Comments**: Bot reminds if tag is missing
5. **Tag Position Verification**: Ensures tag is at branch HEAD

### Security Enhancements ðŸ”’
1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated against strict patterns
2. **Command Injection Prevention**: Version and branch names sanitized
3. **Information Security**: Sensitive details not exposed in errors
4. **Access Control**: Bot exclusions and permission restrictions
5. **Markdown Safety**: PR descriptions properly escaped

### Advanced Features âœ…
1. **Force Re-tag**: Can move tags if no GitHub release exists (edge cases)
2. **Smart Tag Detection**: Skips if tag already at correct position
3. **Release Protection**: Blocks moving tags with GitHub releases
4. **Build Verification**: Checks for successful builds before tagging

### Fallback Protection âœ…
- If someone forgets to tag first, the system:
  - Shows warnings but doesn't block
  - Creates tag automatically (with warning)
  - Logs that proper process wasn't followed
  - Still creates release successfully

## Benefits
1. **Aligns with Mobile**: Both platforms use same process
2. **Clear Traceability**: Tags point to exact QA-tested code
3. **Prevents Confusion**: No more merge commit vs release commit issues
4. **Better Auditing**: Clear record of what was tested and released
5. **Security Hardened**: Protection against injection attacks
6. **Flexible Recovery**: Force re-tag option for fixing mistakes

## Risk Level: **MINIMAL**
- Fully backward compatible
- Can't break existing releases
- Warnings guide correct behavior
- Automatic fallback if process skipped
- Security vulnerabilities addressed
- Input validation prevents malicious actions

## Recommendation
**APPROVE** - Production-ready enhancement with security hardening and safety mechanisms

## Implementation
1. **Main Workflow**: `tag-release-branch.yml` (enhanced with security)
2. **Check Workflow**: `check-release-tag.yml` (automated verification)
3. **Script Updated**: `release-create-gh-release.sh` (smart tag handling)
4. **Security Hardening**: Input validation, error sanitization, access controls
5. **Documentation**: Complete with security review
