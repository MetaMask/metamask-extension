# The .circleci/ folder instructs Circle CI on the process by which it
# should test, build and publish releases of our application. Due to the
# impact that changes to the files contained within this folder may have
# on our releases, only those with the knowledge and responsibility to
# publish libraries under the MetaMask name may approve those changes.
# Note to reviewers: We employ the use of CircleCI "Orbs", which are
# remotely hosted sections of CircleCI configuration and scripts, to
# empower our CI steps. ANY addition of orbs to our CircleCI config
# should be brought to the attention of engineering leadership for
# discussion

# The privacy-snapshot.json file includes a list of all hosts that the
# extension communicates with during the E2E test suite runs. It is not a
# complete list of all hosts that the extension communicates with until the E2E
# test suite has full coverage. Anytime the privacy-snapshot file changes,
# extra scrutiny should be applied to the pull request to confirm that it does
# not broaden the number of hosts the extension communicates with without also
# providing a path for users to avoid that communication. MetaMask strives to
# make all such communication opt IN versus opt OUT.
